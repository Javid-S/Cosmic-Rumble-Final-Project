# Cosmic Rumble 🚀

Cosmic Rumble is a pixel-art inspired arcade-style shooter game developed as a final project for Stanford’s Code in Place 2025. It features fast-paced action across three visually distinct worlds: Elf Kingdom, Tech Heights, and Cyber Hell.

## 🌟 Inspiration

This project is a creative homage to the classic **Space Impact** game that came pre-installed on early mobile phones. I wanted to recreate that fun, addictive energy—but with my own twist: multiple worlds, chaotic dimension rifts, and stylized pixel art.

## 🎮 Features

- 3 unique themed worlds with custom enemies, bosses, bullets, and backgrounds
- Smooth player movement, shooting, and collision detection
- Boss battles that scale in difficulty
- Retro-inspired fonts and UI
- World selection screen with glowing effects and stylized menu
- Designed using **Pygame** and beginner-friendly code structure

## 🔀 Story Twist

As the cosmos fractured, worlds collided. Now, an Elf King fights a spaceship, a cyborg rebel takes down a mythical beast, and a space ranger faces a rogue AI. Nothing makes sense anymore… but everything must be saved.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.13**
- **Pygame 2.6.1**
- Pixel art assets (custom and sourced)
- VS Code on Windows

## 🚧 Limitations

- Game state isn’t saved between sessions
- No sound/music (for simplicity)
- Some asset transitions are abrupt but intentional for contrast

## 📂 How to Run

1. Make sure Python and Pygame are installed.
2. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Javid-S/Cosmic-Rumble-Final-Project-.git
   cd Cosmic-Rumble-Final-Project-

3. run the game 

    bash
   
         python main.py
