# 🌌 Cosmic Rumble

Welcome to **Cosmic Rumble** — a pixel-art inspired arcade shooter built with Pygame for Stanford’s [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) 2025.

In this game, worlds have shattered, and chaos has begun. Rifts in the cosmic fabric have merged realms of magic, technology, and hellfire — and you're caught in the middle of it all.

## 💡 Inspiration

This game is a personal homage to **Space Impact**, the first digital game I ever played on a Nokia mobile phone. That little pixelated spaceship sparked my love for games, and I’ve always wanted to recreate that magic in my own way — bigger, bolder, with dragons, spaceships, and cyberpunk chaos all rolled into one.
